## Program detail
This project is a task scheduler implementation that simulates different scheduling algorithms.
It takes two inputs from the command line: a scheduling algorithm (chosen by the user) and a text file containing task details. 
The scheduler then processes the tasks based on the selected algorithm and 
provides statistics such as average turnaround time, waiting time, and response time.
